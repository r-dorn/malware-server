when we create a new key we will generate a random connection code and a random uuid to be set as the generated keys id
then we will store a computed hmac along with the connectionKeys id in redis

---------example-model---------

    type RedisConnectionKey struct {
        ConnectionKeyID string
        ConnectionKeyHmac string
    }

---------example-model---------

when we recieve a provided connection key we will decode the provided connectionKey and retreive the keys id then we will lookup the retreived id if this is successful
we will calculate hmac of the provided json body if this fails we know the user has submitted a tampered token this will blacklist the requesters ip <implementation pending>
